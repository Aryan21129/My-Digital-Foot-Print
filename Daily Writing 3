NLP is game changing 
No one can imagine Future of AI Without 
And the biggest game changing paper is 'Attention Is All You Need'
Even though I not even understand it properly but I loved it so much that I have taken out print of it 
NLP is a very big concept and we don't even knew how big it will Contribute To next coming Generation of AI!
